# Mini compiler for Java simple variable declaration 
The application was created using JavaFX. It features 5 working buttons: "Open File" button, "Lexical Analysis" button, "Syntax Analysis" button, "Semantic Analysis" button, and "Clear" button. The application works by inputting a simple Java variable declaration statement, this is achieved by click on the open file button. If the input is lexically correct, then it should display in the result box that the lexical analysis phase is successful then the lexical analysis button should be disabled and the syntax analysis button should be enabled. If the lexical analysis phase is not successful, then the user would not be able to move forward, the only enabled button would be the clear button. This means that the user should start from the start. The same goes for the syntax and semantic analysis phases.
